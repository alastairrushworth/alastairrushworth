I'm a data scientist / ML engineer, and enjoy making things with code and data. 

Some recent things I've made
- 🔎 [blognerd.app](https://blognerd.app): a search engine for blog sites and posts, mostly streamlit and pinecone with a lot of RSS feeds.
- 🚲 [cyclearchive.com](https://cyclearchive.com): a Zola static site hosting old (mostly pre-1900s) cycling magazines.
- 🗞️ [blaze.email](https://blaze.email): AI-curated techs email service - uses postgres, pinecone, AWS SES and streamlit.
- 📊 [inspectpd](https://github.com/alastairrushworth/inspectpd): python method patches for quick inspection and visualisation of pandas dataframes.

I work less in R now, but previously made
- a [Tour de France data package](https://github.com/alastairrushworth/tdf)
- [inspectdf](https://github.com/alastairrushworth/inspectdf), a package for comparing and visualising dataframes
- [htmldf](https://github.com/alastairrushworth/htmldf), tools for dataframe-centric webscraping
- A list of really good R learning materials [free-data-science](https://github.com/alastairrushworth/free-data-science)

My personal site is at [https://alastairrushworth.com](https://alastairrushworth.com/posts), where I infrequently write blog posts. Before I worked in ML, I lectured in statistics some [papers from that time can be found on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=imiL1YoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [PDFs here](https://github.com/alastairrushworth/assets).
