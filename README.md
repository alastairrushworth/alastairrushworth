I'm a data scientist / ML engineer, and enjoy making things with code and data.

Some recent things I've made
- 🔎 [https://blognerd.app](https://blognerd.app): a search engine for blog sites and posts, using streamlit and a lot of RSS feeds.
- 🚲 [https://cyclearchive.com](https://cyclearchive.com): a simple library of very old (mostly pre-1900s) cycling magazines.
- 🗞️ [https://blaze.email](https://blaze.email): a curated weekly email service covering several topics in ML, data and tech
